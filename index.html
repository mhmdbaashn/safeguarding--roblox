                <p>It is everyone’s responsibility to protect children and young people and keep
                    them safe.
                    It is important that families, communities and professionals can recognise when a child or young
                    person
                    is being harmed and that they know what action to take in response.</p>

                        <p>The Roblox boom is giving some parents pause, as they wonder if the game's multiplayer format
                            and
                            free and open communication policy are safe for kids. As with any video game with these
                            features, there are some risks, but overall, Roblox can be a safe gaming platform for older
                            children according to experts—especially when parents take some precautions.
                            Here, we dive into what Roblox is, potential risks you should know about, and how you can
                            keep
                            your child safe from the risks experts want all parents to know about.</p>
